# Functionality
Adds indicators as to whether you possess an item in any of the game's item storages (only storages where the item was found are displayed/mentioned in the resulting display)
* Storages checked
  * Bank
  * Combat loot container
  * All equipment sets and food slots
  * All stockpiles in Cooking
* Areas displayed
  * When hovering over an item in the Bank
  * When selecting an item in the bank, as new section in the sidebar
  * When hovering over an item in the Combat Loot Container
  * When hovering over an item in a cooking stockpile
  * When hovering over a trade option in township
    * The pre-existing bank info is not affected, only additional ones added

Feel free to let me know about other areas this information should be displayed in, as well as feedback about how (and which) information is displayed.

# Ideas
Additional areas in which to display:
* When hovering over an equipment/food slot
* In droptable displays
* In fitting areas on Skill pages

New display options (would be toggleable, probably per area, not just for all at once):
* Rather than showing the exact amount, only show that you have any amount (> 0) in that storage
* Only show if you have any amount (> 0) in any storage

# Translations
Languages other than English and German have been translated using machine translation, 
so quality and accuracy cannot be guaranteed and likely contains errors (for some exceptions, where I utilized texts provided by the game itself). 
And, as I can't speak most of the languages, even seemingly obvious errors can end up happen. 
Please feel free to let me know about anything that should be changed through the above channels.
