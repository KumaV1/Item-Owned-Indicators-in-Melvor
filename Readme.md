**For Indicators in the Shop, check out [Shop Item Owned Indicator](https://mod.io/g/melvoridle/m/shop-item-owned-indicator)**

---

Adds indicators as to whether you possess an item in any of the game's item storages (only storages where the item was found are displayed/mentioned in the resulting display)

* Storages checked
  * Bank
  * Combat loot container
  * All equipment sets and food slots
  * All stockpiles in Cooking
* Areas displayed
  * When hovering over an item in the Combat Loot Container
  * When selecting an item in the bank

Feel free to let me know about other areas this information should be displayed in, as well as feedback about how (and which) information is displayed (e.g. adding mod settings to only display certain storages).

Current ideas for additional areas to display storages in (areas of interest would become toggleable through Mod settings):

* When hovering over an equipment/food slot
* When hovering over a cooking stockpile
* Maybe also when hovering over an item, similar to the behaviour in the Combat Loot Container
